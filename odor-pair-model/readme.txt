To generate the 33-label odor-pair model, the following steps must be taken:
1- Download the odor-pair script from https://github.com/odor-pair/odor-pair
2- Train the 33 odor-pair models (the pre-trained model and the list of labels and AUROC are available in the current folder, model_33.pt and labels.csv)
3- To test the performance of the model use "ModelPerformance.ipynb" notebook.
4- To generate 33 label odor-pair for any mixture use "33label_mixture_prediction.ipynb" notebook.
